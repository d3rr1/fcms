# FahnerCMS

Main repository for the FahnerCMS. An advanced WYSIWYG content management system for the web. The most important features include:

* A (JSON) REST-API to easily connect more applications to the same data and logic
* WYSIWIG page and content editing
* Automatic mobile web support (work in progress)
* Completely customisable both in looks and functionality

Note that this is still very much a work in progress. Many of the features described above may not yet be implemented.

## Technologies

The system is built using PHP/MySQL for the backend (the REST-API) and communicates via JSON to any front-end application.
By default the system comes with a default web-implementation mainly written in JavaScript (+ jQuery) and ofcourse uses HTML/CSS for presentation.
